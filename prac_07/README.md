## About the Repository

This repository contains CP1404 programming II practicals. These practicals
help students better their knowledge of Python code with various
exercises.

## About Me

My name is Harry Groemer. I was born and raised in Townsville until
I moved to Brisbane for University Studies. Due to covid complications,
I moved back to Townsville to continue my course at JCU!

## Lessons Learned in Clean Code

- **Follow the Patterns:** There is no need to waste time reinventing
  new/different ways to do "standard" things. I try to use the patterns I've
  learned to be as efficient as I can.
- **Comments:** Comments should be used to explain why something
  is done, not what is done. Do not use too many or repeat comments.
- **Avoid Repetition** Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself. If you find yourself doing
  so, refactor it into a single function.
